# Bitcoin-Hashing
Mining bitcoins by generating random input strings and hashing them using the SHA256 algorithm. These mined coins are checked to ensure they have the required number of leading zeros in their prefix specified by the user. F# and AKKA actor model is used to build a good solution that runs efficiently on multi-core machines.
